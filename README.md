# Hamming-Shannon_fano
Consider a discrete memoryless source with symbols and statistics {0.125, 0.0625, 0.25, 0.0625, 0.125, 0.125, 0.25} for its output. 
Apply the Huffman and Shannon-Fano to this source. 
Show that draw the tree diagram, the average code word length, Entropy, Variance, Redundancy, Efficiency.

AIM:
To compute the Average Codeword Length, Entropy, Efficiency, Redundancy, and Variance for a discrete memoryless source using Huffman and Shannon-Fano coding based on the given probabilities and codeword lengths.

TOOLS REQUIRED:
Python: A versatile programming language used for scientific computing and signal processing. NumPy: A powerful numerical library in Python for performing array-based operations and mathematical computations. Matplotlib: A plotting library for generating high-quality graphs and visualizations of data, essentialfor demonstrating the sampling process.
